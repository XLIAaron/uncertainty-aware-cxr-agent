> **Status:** We are actively updating this repository. **User instructions**, **trained weights**, and a **demo notebook** will be uploaded soon.

## Overview
AT-CXR is an uncertainty-aware agent that performs selective automation for CXR triage with guardrails, optional routing to TTA/MoE/VLM, and post-accept utilities.
Current experiments focus on pulmonary edema, chosen as a representative clinical application.
